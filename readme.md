# My personal website

### 2021's new website!

New year and everything comes new. My old website is still avaliable at https://jjpaulo2.github.io/mysite-legacy, but it won't get future updates. I'm keeping it to guard old memories from the time I was learning web development.

Now my site is fully hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Here in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jjpaulo2) you can find 2 repositories that contains the [front-end](https://github.com/jjpaulo2/mysite-front-end) and [back-end](https://github.com/jjpaulo2/mysite-rest-api) from my site.

1) **Back-end** [[reposity here]](https://github.com/jjpaulo2/mysite-rest-api)

I made a **Rest API** using [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). It's hosted at https://jjpaulo2-api.herokuapp.com. There I can add, delete and edit my personal informations. This is a really necessary thing for me, and was the main reason for built this site.

1) **Front-end** [[reposity here]](https://github.com/jjpaulo2/mysite-front-end)

**SPA** built in [Angular 10](https://angular.io/) with a personal layout. It's hosted at https://jjpaulo2.herokuapp.com. It queries my API and shows the informations that I did put there.
